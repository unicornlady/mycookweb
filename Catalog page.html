        Egg hoppers are a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from fermented rice
        flour batter cooked in a bowl-shaped pan. An egg is cracked into the
        center of the batter, creating a thin, crispy pancake with a soft
        center. These hoppers are often served with various accompaniments like
        sambal (spicy relish) or curry, making them a popular and
        flavorful meal or snack.
